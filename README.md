Cryptography Algorithm(AES) for cloud storage.
# About Dual Access
-> Dual access control is particularly useful for organization that requires strict data security measure to protect confidential information. 
-> It combines two levels of access control: one at the cloud service provider's side and the other at the user's side. 
-> By implementing dual access control, organizations can enhance the  the protection of sensitive data and maintain control over who has  access to it. 

# ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) 
-> A user decides to use cloud services and transfer their data to the cloud. 
-> Whenever an application uploads any data to the cloud, the data is encrypted and then sent. 
-> Any requests to read the data will happen after it is decrypted on the users end.

Click the "Key Generation" button and enter your password to initiate the authentication process. Once authenticated, you can encrypt your file and send it to the intended recipient. The recipient can then decrypt and read the file. This ensures the protection of sensitive data from unauthorized access.
