Cryptography Algorithm(AES) for cloud storage.
# About Dual Access
-> Dual access control is particularly useful for organization that requires strict data security measure to protect confidential information. 
-> It combines two levels of access control: one at the cloud service provider's side and the other at the user's side. 
-> By implementing dual access control, organizations can enhance the  the protection of sensitive data and maintain control over who has  access to it. 

# ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD (AES) 
-> A user decides to use cloud services and transfer their data to the cloud. 
-> Whenever an application uploads any data to the cloud, the data is encrypted and then sent. 
-> Any requests to read the data will happen after it is decrypted on the users end.
